## welcome.

if you have a frontend and/or backend, you can find your container wireframes in ./nginx_router/[frontend, backend]/

if you are using a database, the mounted volume is ./database/data/

if you are using a CI/CD pipeline, don't forget to set this repo up in its corresponding service!

here's to the start of a great project!
